[CloudFormation](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) is a facility in Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows you to describe the architecture and configuration of resources on the AWS platform.  This is done using CloudFormation (CFN) Templates which declare the resources and their interdependencies in a JSON document.

This PowerShell module provides a set of cmdlets and supporting tools that allow you to describe and generate CFN Templates using the semantics and features of the PowerShell scripting language.
